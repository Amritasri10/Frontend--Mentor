# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

## Overview

This is my solution to the FAQ accordion challenge. It was built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
